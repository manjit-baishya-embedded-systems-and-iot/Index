# **INDEX**

Hi, my name is `Manjit Baishya` and welcome to my Repository Index. I've been tinkering with various languages and hardware development kits, so keeping everything organized can be quite a challenge. This repository is my way of keeping all my work neat and tidy.

## **Assembly Language** ü§ñ
**Language: `ASM`**

During my engineering curriculum, I dived into Assembly language on `8085` and `8051`. It's fascinating how a few lines of code can control billions of transistors. I took it further and taught myself `8086`. Below are the repositories:

- [**The 8085 Archive**](https://github.com/manjit-baishya-embedded-systems-and-iot/The-8085-Archieve)
- [**The 8086 Archive**](https://github.com/manjit-baishya-embedded-systems-and-iot/The-8086-Archieve)
- [**The 8051 Archive**]()

These `ARCHIVES` contain starter programs for the microprocessors. Since I couldn't find an `EDA` Tool that supports simulation for `8085` and `8086`, these projects are wrapped up in simple codes!

- [**8085 Project Archive**]()
- [**8086 Project Archive**]()

For 8051, I performed simulations using the `Proteus` Circuit Simulation Tool. Each project is neatly organized in separate folders.

These are all my works with `Assembly` Language.

## **C Projects** üíª
**Language: `C`**

Starting out with C as my first programming language was such a game-changer for me. Seriously, it's been like having a solid foundation that everything else builds upon. The basics just clicked, you know? I could practically see how everything was working under the hood in my mind, and that made learning other languages a breeze.

Thanks to C, I've been able to dive into both software and hardware projects with confidence. There's something about C that just makes everything feel tangible and understandable. It's like the language itself has this clarity that translates into whatever I'm working on. I have added a small repository which aids in refreshing the mind of the basics and syntax of C which has been given as:

- [**The C Archive**](https://github.com/manjit-baishya-embedded-systems-and-iot/The-C-Archieve)

I have also developed small CLI Applications which I have summed up in:

## **Arduino UNO Projects** üîß
**Language: `Embedded C`**

I'm all about diving into Arduino UNO projects! They're like a playground for turning my ideas into reality and getting a deeper grasp of electronics. But you know what? No matter how much I think I've got a handle on things, the projects always have a surprise or two in store.

So, I've been busy organizing all my projects into a single index. It just makes sense, you know? Instead of scattered repositories, now there's this neat little hub where I can showcase each project with a brief description and a link. It's like giving readers a guided tour of my tinkering adventures.

## **ESP32 Projects** üì∂
**Language: `Micropython`**

Regardless of all the hardware stuff that I do, I just cannot think how different it would be when I do it with **`Python`**. As a result, I flashed my **`ESP32`** with the **`Micropython`** binary and got it running with it. I use **`PyMakr`** for loading the projects.

**`SPOILER ALERT`**: ESP32 supports running ML Algorithms!!!

## **ESP32 CAM Projects** üì∑
**Language: `Micropython`**

Even though I have an **`ESP32 CAM`** Module, aka, **`AI Thinker`**, I've just been brainstorming about the projects.

## **Arduino Nano Projects** ‚ö°
**Language: `Rust`**

I'm also thinking of purchasing an Arduino **`Nano`** in the near future so that I can lay my hands on **`Rust`** for Embedded Systems.

### **THANK YOU** üôè

This is my GitHub Repository INDEX. I hope you find it organized and easy to navigate.
