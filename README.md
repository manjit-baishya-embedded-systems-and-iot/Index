# **INDEX**

Hi, my name is `Manjit Baishya` and this is my Repository Index. I have been working on many different languages and several hardware development kits so it is very difficult to keep them organised. With the help of this repository, I aim to keep all my work organised. 

## **Assembly Language**
As a part of my Engineering Carriculum, I have been taught Assembly language on `8085` and `8051`. To me this has always sparked asense of astonishment how we are able to control billions of transistors with just a few lines of code. I later decided to educate myself on `8086`. The repositories have been listed below:

1. [**The 8085 Archieve**]()
2. [**The 8086 Archieve**]()
3. [**The 8051 Archieve**]()

These `ARCHIEVES` contain programs to get started with the microprocessor. I was unable to find an `EDA` Tool that supported thesimulation of `8085`, so I had to wrap up the projects of 8085 in simple codes! For 8086 and 8051, I have performed the simulations in `Proteus` Circuit Simulation Tool. I have created separate repositories for each and every project and they have een organised furthur in the ollowing ones.

1. [**8085 Project Index**]()
2. [**8086 Project Index**]()
3. [**8051 Project Index**]()

These are all my work with `Assembly` Language.

## **The C Programming Language**
Starting out with C as my first programming language was such a game-changer for me. Seriously, it's been like having a solid foundation that everything else builds upon. The basics just clicked, you know? I could practically see how everything was working under the hood in my mind, and that made learning other languages a breeze.

Thanks to C, I've been able to dive into both software and hardware projects with confidence. There's something about C that just makes everything feel tangible and understandable. It's like the language itself has this clarity that translates into whatever I'm working on. I have added a small repository which aids in refreshing the mind of the basics and syntax of C which has been given as:

- [**The C Archieve**]()

I have also developed small CLI Applications which I have summed up in:

- [**CLI Applications with C**]()

Franly speaking, development with `GTK4` has been really difficult and so I will try to keep this as an ongoing project forever, developing small and helpful applications on the go.
