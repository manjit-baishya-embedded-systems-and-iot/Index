# **INDEX**

Hi, my name is `Manjit Baishya` and this is my Repository Index. I have been working on many different languages and several hardware development kits so it is very difficult to keep them organised. With the help of this repository, I aim to keep all my work organised. 

## **Assembly Language**
**`ASM`**
<br>As a part of my Engineering Carriculum, I have been taught Assembly language on `8085` and `8051`. To me this has always sparked asense of astonishment how we are able to control billions of transistors with just a few lines of code. I later decided to educate myself on `8086`. The repositories have been listed below:

- [**The 8085 Archieve**](https://github.com/manjit-baishya-embedded-systems-and-iot/The-8085-Archieve)
- [**The 8086 Archieve**](https://github.com/manjit-baishya-embedded-systems-and-iot/The-8086-Archieve)
- [**The 8051 Archieve**]()

These `ARCHIEVES` contain programs to get started with the microprocessor. I was unable to find an `EDA` Tool that supported the simulation of `8085` and `8086`, so I had to wrap up the projects in simple codes! 

- [**8085 Project Archieve**]()
- [**8086 Project Archieve**]()

For 8051, I have performed the simulations in `Proteus` Circuit Simulation Tool. I have created separate folders for each and every project and they have een organised furthur in the following ones.

These are all my work with `Assembly` Language.

## **The C Programming Language**
**`C`**

Starting out with C as my first programming language was such a game-changer for me. Seriously, it's been like having a solid foundation that everything else builds upon. The basics just clicked, you know? I could practically see how everything was working under the hood in my mind, and that made learning other languages a breeze.

Thanks to C, I've been able to dive into both software and hardware projects with confidence. There's something about C that just makes everything feel tangible and understandable. It's like the language itself has this clarity that translates into whatever I'm working on. I have added a small repository which aids in refreshing the mind of the basics and syntax of C which has been given as:

- [**The C Archieve**](https://github.com/manjit-baishya-embedded-systems-and-iot/The-C-Archieve)

I have also developed small CLI Applications which I have summed up in:

- [**CLI Applications with C**]()

## **Arduino UNO Projects**
**`Embedded C`**

I'm all about diving into Arduino UNO projects! They're like a playground for turning my ideas into reality and getting a deeper grasp of electronics. But you know what? No matter how much I think I've got a handle on things, the projects always have a surprise or two in store.

So, I've been busy organizing all my projects into a single index. It just makes sense, you know? Instead of scattered repositories, now there's this neat little hub where I can showcase each project with a brief description and a link. It's like giving readers a guided tour of my tinkering adventures.

## **ESP32 Projects**
**`Micropython`**

Regardless of all the hardware stuff that I do, I just cannot think how different will it be when I do it with **`Python`**. As a result, I flashed my **`ESP32`** with the **`Micropython`** binary and got it running with it. I use **`PyMakr`** for loading the projects.

**`SPOILER ALERT`**: ESP32 support running ML Algorithms!!!

## **ESP32 CAM Projects**
**`Micropython`**

Even though I have a **`ESP32 CAM`** Module, aka, **`AI Thinker`**, I have just been thinking about the projects.

## **Arduino Nano Projects**
**`Rust`**

I am also thinking of purchasing an Ardunino **`Nano`** in the near future so that I can lay my hands on **`Rust`** for Embedded Systems.
